    <h2>Welcome to my Netflix Clone</h2>
    <p><i>(still in construction)</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>This is a Netflix Clone Front-End UI React App. Responsive and without hardcoded variables.
        Within every iteration or update the movie banner is selected randomly, also every movie card has an onClick event that triggers a request and returns a Youtube video that is played below the row of the selected movie (dependency "movie-trailer" not fetching data correctly since last API update, this results in 60% of the videos not rendering, try with various clicks on different movies).
        The movies info was fetched through Axios with TMDB endpoints responding JSON.
        Used several dependencies (check package.json).</p>
