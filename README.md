    <h2>Welcome to my Netflix Clone</h2>
    <p><i>(still in construction)</i></p>

    <p>This is a Netflix Clone Front-End UI React App. Responsive and without hardcoded.
        Every iteration or update the banner movie is selected randomly, also onClick events
        a Youtube video is played (dependency "movie-trailer" not fetching data correctly
        since last API update, this results in 60%-70% of the videos not rendering, try with
        various movies).
        The movies info was fetched through Axios with TMDB endpoints responding JSON.
        Used several dependencies (check package.json).</p>
